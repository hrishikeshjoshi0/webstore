				Do you accept returned items?: <br/><br/>
				
				YES. We have a very simple and clear return policy. Due to any reason, if you wish to return the purchases, we will happily provide you with an exchange or full refund. You are free to return or exchange your purchases within 30 days from the date of delivery. Itâ€™s that simple. Our 30 days return policy gives you plenty of time to consider your purchase. Hence, you can be sure of your decision. We will keep the returned item for 20 days inspection (the returned item will be kept with us for a period of 20 days, for inspection). Our Quality Assurance Team will scrutinize the returned item. You will be refunded within 10 days following the inspection period. You will be given full refund to the original form of payment only. However, shipping charges (i.e., US $ 25 flat) and payment process charges (payment transaction charges) will be deducted, if any incurred.
				The only thing you need to be careful is that the item must be returned in the original condition i.e. unchanged, undamaged and tampered free including the certificate, invoice, other documents, free gifts, complete original packaging, etc.
				Kindly inform us your intension of return through email (for our record and feedback).
